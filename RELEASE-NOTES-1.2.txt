Release Notes for VNC Snapshot 1.2
=========================================
New in this release is the ability to get multiple snapshots, using the
-count and -fps options.

This release also includes a version of vncpasswd usable on Windows.
vncpasswd is also built on Unix/Linux systems to allow you to use it without
a full VNC installation.

Bug fixes include:
 * Under some circumstances, a blank screen would be captured even if
   -ignoreblank was specified.
 * Makefiles have been edited to work better on some non-Linux systems.
 * Compilation errors on Mac OS X (Darwin) have been fixed

A new build script, make_release_bin, for Linux/Unix systems is also provided;
it is intended for use by the maintainer to create compiled versions of the
programs on multiple platforms with minimum pain.
