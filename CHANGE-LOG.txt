1.2a
 * Fixed bug where the snapshot, by default, would start 60 pixels
   down from the top of the screen
 * Fixed up Windows zlib.dsp (1.2 release was still 1.1.x zlib.dsp,
   despite change log and README entries)
 * Minor enhancments to developer make_release_bin and run-sf-compiles
   scripts

   mentioned, but are in README)
1.2
 * Upgraded Windows build to Zlib 1.2.1

 * Fixed bug where snapshot thought it had got a non-blank screen when
   in fact it hadn't (bug resulted in blank screen captures)
 * Fixed to compile on Mac OS X

   work with all servers)
1.1
 * Included UltraVNC RFB definitions in header files. UltraVNC encodings
   and scalings are not supported yet, however.

 * Merged Tight VNC 1.2.7 sources
 * When saving a sub-area of the server's screen, only that part is fetched
   (formerly the entire screen was fetched)
 * New '-ignoreblank' and '-allowblank' to work around RealVNC servers that
   send an initial blank screen.
 * Now supports '-cursor' and '-nocursor' options; unfortunately these only
   work for recent TightVNC servers
 * Merged RealVNC 3.3.6 sources
 * Now supports both TightVNC 'tight' and 'zlib' encodings and RealVNC
   'zrle' encoding.
 * Dropped beta status as I got no bug reports (in fact, no reports at all)
 * -tunnel and -via options now supported for all platforms (not tested on Windows)
 * Fix: coordinates of -0 (0 pixels from right/bottom edge) now work
 * Win32 Release build works
