Release Notes for VNC Snapshot 1.1
=========================================

This is the second release of VNC snapshot. It has been tested on Windows,
Linux and Solaris Sparc systems.

This version merges the TightVNC 1.2.8 and RealVNC 3.3.7 code, including the
ZRLE encoding.

Semantics of the -rect option has changed. Formerly, when giving negative x
and y (e.g. -rect 400x300-400-300) the x and y coordinates were of the top
left corner of the rectangle. This meant that you usually had to add in the
size of the rectangle. Now, the negative value refers to the right or bottom
edge. Thus, in 1.0b1 the option:
  -rect 400x300-400-300
is now
  -rect 400x300-0-0
which is more readable (and sensible). This also now corresponds to the way
Unix X11 -geometry specifications work.

Two new pairs of options are available.

The first is -cursor and -nocursor, which cause the remote cursor to be
included, or excluded, from the snapshot. They will work with TightVNC
servers only, unfortunately.

The second is -allowblank and -ignoreblank, which cause blank (all black)
screens to be saved, or ignored. -ignoreblank is the default and is
appropriate for recent RealVNC servers on Windows systems, which send an
all-blank screen at first before sending the actual image.

Performance improvements have also been made when fetching a sub-rectangle
of the screen; previously the entire screen would be retreived from the
remote server, and the sub-rectangle extracted from that. Now, only the area
to be saved is retrieved. This should reduce the amount of data sent across
the network.

Note: -listen, -tunnel, and -via are implemented but untested for Windows
systems.
